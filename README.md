# Blunder
## What is Blunder?
Blunder is an Open-Source graphics engine that started as a project for my Graphics Programming course, which I've decided to keep making outside of the class. The goal of Blunder is to, while not being the best 3D software, provide a unique rendering experience where shaders can be custom-written, similar to how shader nodes are used in Blender (hence the namesake).

## Current Status
Currently, Blunder is in development and will likely be at least a month until it is usable as an actual piece of software.
I'm currently working on creating a hierarchy data structure that will then be used to render and interact with the hierarchy UI piece. From this, other tools will have to be created to manage hierarchy relations and creations/deletions of objects. 

## Why Blunder?
Idk man, it's just fun to make stuff, and I highly recommend doing so with OpenGL, where you can make all of the visuals yourself :D
